# Welcome

### Thank you for exploring S & D Period Tracker.

It is a web-based lightweight Data Entry application that keeps track of Women's Menstruation Cycle and Provides Estimates for Future.

This application is developed using Node.js, Express.js, HTML, and CSS. MongoDB is used as a database. The user interface is responsive and minimal.

**Feel free to Clone and Fork. Commercial Distribution is Prohibited.**

## Background (_Why this application was developed?_)

My wife Deepa, missed her period by a few days. We were quite scared if she is pregnant. It's not that we don't want to have a baby but we are not ready yet. As doctors suggest, a missed period could be a sign of pregnancy, so we decided to keep track of it.

First, I asked for her permission if she is okay with it. Once I got okay from her, I decided to build this application instead of using third-party apps to keep our personal information private. And here it is.
